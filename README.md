# go-assets-builder
go-assets-builder is a simple asset builder program to generate embedded assets
using [go-assets](https://github.com/jessevdk/go-assets). This builder program
exposes the various [go-assets](https://github.com/jessevdk/go-assets) generator
options as command line options and allows for convenient generation of
go embedded assets from for example a Makefile.
